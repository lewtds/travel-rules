= Travel Rules Database

Travel rules around the world as an executable Datalog database.

The travel rules for each nation state is specified in its own Datalog file in the `./host-countries` folder in the 3 letter ISO3166 1 alpha 3 format. Preferably each rule should have a referenced source that could be checked regularly for updates.

An example session:

- Fill in your personal travel information, including passports, visas and/or residence permits you hold (see the sample files in the `./facts` folder)
- `make`
- See `output/can_visit_state_formatted.csv`. An excerpt is included here:
